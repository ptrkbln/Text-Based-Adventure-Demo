## üéÆ Text-Based Adventure Demo

My second project (as part of the Programming Basics module) was an interactive **text-based adventure demo** that captures the nostalgic charm of early *'90s games*, crafted entirely with **JavaScript**.

> This adventure runs entirely in the console as a classic **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application, using `process.argv` to enhance the command-line experience and immerse players in a world of choice-driven storytelling.

**Features include:**
- üßô Character Creation
- ‚öîÔ∏è Turn-Based Combat
- üéí Item Collection
- üß™ Potion Usage
- üìà Leveling Up & Stat Increases
- üé≠ Choice-Based Story Development

Each decision shapes the story‚Äôs progression, making every journey unique and evoking the excitement of classic RPGs.

#### How to Play
Simply open the `main.js` file with Node and let the adventure begin:
```bash
node main.js
