## 🎮 Text-Based Adventure Demo

My second project (as part of the Programming Basics module) was an interactive **text-based adventure demo** that captures the nostalgic charm of early *'90s games*, crafted entirely with **JavaScript**.

> This adventure runs entirely in the console as a classic **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application, using `process.argv` and `readline-sync` to enhance the command-line experience and immerse players in a world of choice-driven storytelling.

**Features include:**
- 🧙 Character Creation
- ⚔️ Turn-Based Combat
- 🎒 Item Collection
- 🧪 Potion Usage
- 📈 Leveling Up & Stat Increases
- 🎭 Choice-Based Story Development

Each decision shapes the story’s progression, making every journey unique and evoking the excitement of classic RPGs.

#### How to Play
1. First, install `readline-sync` to ensure everything runs smoothly:
   ```bash
   npm install readline-sync
2. Once installed, open the main.js file with Node and let the adventure begin:
   ```bash
   node main.js
